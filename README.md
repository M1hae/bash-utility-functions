# Bash utility functions
This repo contains a collection of bash helper function which are most likely used in the daily scripting with bash. Yeah I probably know what you think! Most of the devs will say: "Bla bla bla just use python for it bla bla bla".

I have to admit yes it feels a bit strange to still write bash scripts but if you want to write a small script you probably dont want to use the python club.
